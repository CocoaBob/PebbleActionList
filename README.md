# PebbleActionList
Since Pebble OS 3.0, we could find a better solution to replace ActionBarLayer to give users a more flexible actions list, which is called [ActionMenu](http://developer.getpebble.com/docs/c/User_Interface/Window/ActionMenu/#ActionMenu) and it has been used in some of the built-in system apps. But before Pebble SDK 3.3, this feature wasn't included in the SDK, and since SDK 3.3, this feature is still not available for Aplite with SDK 2.x.

I've created this project to implement a simplified single level actions list for all Aplite/Basalt/Chalk platforms, and with more flexible features like preselected items and disabled items.

I use it in my project [PebbleTransilien](https://github.com/CocoaBob/PebbleTransilien), where you can find some demo codes, and here are some screenshots to demonstrate.
